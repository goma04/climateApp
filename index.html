    <div class="mainText">Hi.</div>

    <div class="mainContent">
        <div class="leftSide">I know firsthand that where you live can have a big impact on health and happiness, which
            is why choosing a place to live that makes you feel good is pretty important. Wondering how to decide? It
            might be as easy as taking a quiz. That's right, there are personality quizzes about where to live that are
            actually super accurate. What's more, where you live in relation to the state of your wellbeing is so vital
            that there's actually a term for it. It's called geospatial medicine. According to a study in the journal
            Health, Science, and Place: "Geospatial medicine provides physicians with a more precise clinical
            understanding about where patients live, work, and play, and how a patient’s movement and place history can
            reduce exposure or risks to environmental or social hazards that adversely personal health."
        </div>

        <div class="rightSide">Certain mental and physical health problems can be related to environment. For example,
            if you have seasonal affective disorder, you're probably not going to like living some place where it's
            rarely sunny, like London. If you suffer from migraine headaches, a super changeable or foggy climate, like
            New England or San Francisco, could result in more weather-related migraines, which is not going to add to
            your happiness.
